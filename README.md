\# AKF\_GAM415\_GraphicsGameEngine



A graphics-focused game engine project developed in Unreal Engine as part of the GAM 415: Graphics Game Engine course at Southern New Hampshire University. This repository explores lower-level engine concepts, rendering systems, and graphics-related workflows through hands-on implementation and experimentation.



The project emphasizes understanding how engine-level systems interact with rendering pipelines rather than producing a finished game experience.

\## Project Overview



This project investigates core graphics and engine concepts within Unreal Engine, with a focus on how visual systems are constructed, configured, and optimized. Work in this repository centers on learning-by-building and controlled experimentation with graphics features.



Areas of focus include:



\- Graphics pipeline concepts and engine architecture

\- Materials, shaders, and rendering behavior

\- Procedural and dynamic geometry

\- Data flow between CPU-side systems and GPU rendering

\- Debugging and evaluating visual output



The goal of this project is to build foundational literacy in graphics systems and engine-level thinking that supports future gameplay and rendering work.
